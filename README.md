## Yata - Yet Another Task App

This is a simple command line tool to organise tasks. The main objective here was to practice my very rusty C# skills for an upcoming project.

> Oh C# is just like Java Alex, it's simple Alex, you'll be fine!

It's not but thankfully I had GitHub copilot to help me through this. I can't recomend that enough. It's a great tool.

## Structure

The code is divided into three sub-projects, the Yata.CMD which is the 'view' or GUI part, Yata.Model which is the model and very simple data access layer for flat file storage and the Yata.Tests - which is my first stab at testing in C# \ dotnet core.


## Usage

The tool is very simple to use. It is a command line tool, so you need to open a command prompt and navigate to the folder where you have the Yata.CMD.exe file. You can then run the tool to see the full usage instructions by typing:

```bash
Yata.CMD.exe
```

## Disclaimer

I am not a C# coder. It is unlikely you will learn canonical C# or dotnet coding from this project (but I am trying to be consistant with 'the standard', whether I approve of it or not), nor is it likely that you will become the ultimate task-master by using this tool but hey, feel free if you want to. 

That reminds me, I really need to go do the washing up.
